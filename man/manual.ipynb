The convergence criteria is fulfilled when all the 4 continuous ESS's are larger than the threshold 200 and all topologial ESS's are larger than 200. It is possible to increase these thresholds with `--stop_criteria_continuous_ess_threshold` and `--stop_criteria_topological_ess_threshold`. If the threshold is increased, we are more certain that a stopped chain has converged, but it comes at a price of bigger computation time. Generally it takes a longer time for the topological ESS's to reach 200 than for the continuous. My intuition is that the continuous ESS's measure whether the continuous parameters of the topologies actually found are searched thoroughly, whereas the topological ESS's measure if all equivalent representations of the topology are traversed equally much. The latter is not as important for inference, so it may be useful to have a lower topological ESS threshold than continuous threshold in order not to waste computation time.\n",

    "By default, the stop criteria will be computed every 200,000 step (which corresponds to `--n=4000` for `--m=50`). The longer, the MCMC chain is run, the larger is the chance of a false positive accepted stop criteria. Therefore, it may be a good idea to increase the distance between each check. If one wants 2,000,000 steps between each check one can write `--stop_criteria_frequency 2000000`."

Notice that the target distribution of the coldest chain is our desired target distribution. Inference of an MCMCMC is done by only looking at the admixture graphs of this chain.
